#A2 - Game Theory - Prisoner's Dilemma

Description

This is a Python program that simulates a classic game theory scenario known as the Prisoner's Dilemma. The program allows users to play the game against the computer or watch two computer players compete against each other. The goal is to make decisions based on self-interest and analyze the outcomes of different strategies.

The game is based on an environmental conservation issue, where two rival companies located on different banks of the same river must decide whether to invest in pollution control equipment. The decisions made by the players affect the river's health and their respective companies' success.
How to Play:

    PLAYING AGAINST CEREBRO
    If you want to play against the computer:
        Enter "yes" when prompted.
        Provide your name as the CEO of your company.
        Decide whether to invest in pollution control equipment or not.
        The computer (named Cerebro) will make its decision randomly.
        The program will display the outcomes and determine the winner.

    CCEREVRO VS MULTIVAC
    If you want to watch the computer players compete:
        Enter "no" when prompted.
        Specify the number of rounds you want the game to go for.
        The computer players (Cerebro and Multivac) will make random decisions.
        The program will display the total scores and determine the winner based on accumulated points.

Dependencies

This program requires Python 3.x to run.

Future Improvements

    Add additional strategies and decision-making algorithms for the computer players.
    Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
    Allow customization of game parameters, such as the pay-off matrix.
